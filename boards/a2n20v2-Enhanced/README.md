# A2N20v2 Card Enhanced (Work In Progress)

This is the project version that builds the FPGA bitstream for the 
[Tang Nano 20K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-nano-20k/nano-20k.html)
version of the A2FPGA Apple II card.  It is intended to provide an advanced
feature set that includes a RiscV SoftCore that requires the use of the 
Tang Nano 20K's 8MB of SDRAM and SD Card slot.

The A2N20v2 version supports Apple II, //e, and IIgs models. The v2 card uses a 100-pin 
"a2bridge" CPLD that captures all Apple II, //e, and IIgs signals including the
M2SEL and M2B0 signals necessary for interfacing to the IIgs bus.

It supports all graphics modes on all Apple II models, although software written
for //e double-hires will not usually run on a II, nor will IIgs software run on
a II or //e.  However, the soft switches and display modes are supported on all
models for software you write yourself.

NOTE: This version is considered experimental but will eventually become the
main A2N20v2 release.

New features that this project provides include:

- Persistent storage of configuration settings such as enabling and disabling virtual
cards without requiring different firmware builds, making it easier to resolve compatibility
issues with installed physical cards.

- Moving Apple II Graphics VRAM to SDRAM for more efficient use of FPGA resources, enabling
more features to be implemented in the FPGA. (IIgs graphics still use FPGA BlockRam
for performance)

- A PicoRV32 RiscV 32-bit co-processor that provides SD-Card support for mounting
Apple II disk images from FAT32 volumes via an on-screen display for selecting and
mounting disk images.

- Apple II Disk Support using a RAMDISK-mechanism. Disk images are loaded into SDRAM
 and presented as standard Disk II Controller Card connected drives.

- Ensoniq DOC 5503 sound support with 128K of dedicated sound memory for 32 oscillators

The A2N20v2 has a 4-switch DIP switch that controls the following settings:

1. Enable Scanline effect when set to on
2. Enable Apple II speaker sounds via HDMI when set to on
3. Power-on-Reset Hold - Delay Apple II start-up until FPGA is initialized and running
4. Apple IIgs - Set to on when installed in an Apple IIgs

For ROM 00/01 IIgs models (such as the Woz edition), the A2N20v2 must be placed in Slot 3.  For ROM 03 models, it should work in any slot. This is because it requires the M2B0 signal which is only present in Slot 3 of the original IIgs models, but which is present in slots 1 to size of the ROM 03 model. 

To update the bitstream on the A2N20v2, the most convenient way is to use [OpenFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader)
Mac users with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can just type `brew install openfpgaloader` in the Terminal to install it
Use OpenFPGALoader to program the Tang Nano 20K board via USB with the [a2n20v2_enhanced.fs](impl/pnr/a2n20v2_enhanced.fs) bistream file and run `openfpgaloader -b tangnano20k -f a2n20v2_enhanced.fs`

The project can also be opened and built with the Gowin IDE, either educational
or commercial editions.  Use the `a2n20v2_enhanced.gprj` file in this folder.

Note: When using the Gowin IDE, do not add or remove files from the project or it will
turn the relative file paths into absolute file paths.
